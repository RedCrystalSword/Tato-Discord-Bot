# Tato-Discord-Bot
General purpose discord bot. I'm really new to coding them so its not very good.
This bot is currently under development, with the prefix b!
Some commands include:
b!say (up to ten words) -- The bot repeats what you have said then deletes your message, making it seem like it said it.
b!info (user) -- displays info on specified user.
b!serverinfo -- displays server info
b!kick (user) -- kicks specified user
b!clear -- clears 100 messages from current channel
b!ping -- tests if the bot is online and working
b!eightball (question) -- answers yes or no questions
b!dice (number of sides) -- roles a dice with x amount of sides
and of course b!help
please don;t steal my token I know someone will but please no xd
